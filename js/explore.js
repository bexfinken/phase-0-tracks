// Pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. 
// This isn't a task specific to JavaScript -- your pseudocode should be in plain English 
// Remember that you can add strings in JavaScript, so '' + 'a' would result in the string 'a'. 

// Under your commented pseudocode, implement your function in JavaScript. 
// Add driver code that calls the function 
// Add driver code that prints the variable if some condition is true. The condition can be a silly one, like 1 == 1.


var str = "Loop over me!";
for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  console.log(str[i]);
