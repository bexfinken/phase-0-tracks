// In your new file, declare two separate arrays:
// an array of four colors ("blue", for instance, though you're welcome to get crazy with something like "iridescent blue/green with silver sparkles")
// an array of four names that you might give a horse ("Ed" is always a solid choice to start with)
// Write additional code that adds another color to the colors array, and another horse name to the horses array.

colors: [pink, purple, orange, green]
horseNames: [Mildred, Freddie, Juan, Guadalupe]
