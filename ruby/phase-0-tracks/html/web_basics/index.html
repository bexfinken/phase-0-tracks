<body> <h1>Vultures!</h1>
	<p>They are <strong>amazing</strong>. If we didn't have vultures, what would the world be like?</p>
	<ul>
	<li>There would be rotting carcasses all over the place</li>
	<li>We would have <strong>way</strong> more diseases</li>
	<li>There wouldn't be any <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-13629772">detective vultures in Germany</a></li>
	<li>There wouldn't be any adorable baby vultures</li>
	</ul>
	<p>So, what are the best things about vultures?</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Vomit is their weapon of choice</li>
	<li>Vultures are the Benicio DelToro of Birds</li>
	<li>Did I mention baby vultures?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Next time you see a vulture--and you will, unless you're in Antarctica or Australia--don't hate. Appreciate.
