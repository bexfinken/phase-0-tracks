# Player #1 should be prompted to enter a word/phrase 
# Player #2 tries to guess what it is
# Each letter in the word equals a turn at guessing
# If a guess is repeated (e.g. guess 's' twice) it's considered one turn
# When guessing correctly, the letters should populate the blank spots
# If the player wins, they get cheered "YAY"
# If the player loses, they get booed "WHOMP WHOMP"
