# # Release 2
# Make a loop to make 50 instances of whatever class.
# The loop has to store all the instances in a data structure [array]
# Iterate over that data structure using .each
# call the instance methods you wrote on each instance. 
# So if you wrote a Gymnast class, this is where you'd call .flip and .jump on each of your instances of Gymnast.
