8.4 Many-to-Many Relationships
Release 2



1.You've joined two tables before. How do you join three? 

sqlite> SELECT *
   ...> FROM users
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

id    first_name     last  id    star  comment        bu  user_id        id          name            
----  -------------  ----  ----  ----  -------------  --  -------------  ----------  ----------------
1     Gilbert        Unicorn  1     4     AWESOME        3   1              3           Sprinkles Bakery
2     Hugo           Unicorn  2     2     It was okay    1   2              1           Puppy Daycare   
3     Nigel          Brimblepye  3     3     Pretty good!   4   3              4           Cat Kingdom     
1     Gilbert        Unicorn  4     4     I loved it!    4   1              4           Cat Kingdom     
4     Alistair       Twiddlebumps  5     1     They lost my chew toy!  1   4              1           Puppy Daycare    
    



2.There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
   ...> FROM users 
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> INNER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

firs  last_name      name  star  comm
----  -------------  ----  ----  ----
Gilbert  Unicorn        Sprinkles Bakery  4     AWESOME
Hugo  Unicorn        Puppy Daycare  2     It was okay
Nigel  Brimblepye     Cat Kingdom  3     Pretty good!
Gilbert  Unicorn        Cat Kingdom  4     I loved it!
Alistair  Twiddlebumps   Puppy Daycare  1     They lost my chew toy!

3.How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

sqlite> SELECT * 
   ...> FROM users
   ...> INNER JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> WHERE business_id = 4;

id    first_name     last  id    star  comment        bu  user_id      
----  -------------  ----  ----  ----  -------------  --  -------------
3     Nigel          Brimblepye  3     3     Pretty good!   4   3            
1     Gilbert        Unicorn  4     4     I loved it!    4   1
