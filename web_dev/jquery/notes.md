9.3 jQuery

Release 0: Make a plan


1. 	What sorts of resources will help? 
	Obviously, I'm going to Google first. I think searching for "jquery Mozilla" is a good place to start. There are also docs, so that's a good resource.

	I'm going to narrow down the vastness of Mozilla by looking into one or two the events mentioned in the module: 
	user actions
	response to events
	making an object do stuff. 

	And of course, the cheat sheets.


2. 	How often should you stop and test what you just learned? 
	I think it depends on how difficult I think something is. I might stop and test tiny steps on a particular subject, while I will not be quite as persnickety on other more familiar concepts.

3.	Are breaks important? 
	Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.
