<!-- 9.1 Release 1 -->

1.	What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

2.	In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)?
	It's memory that has been partitioned off just for you. It acts like a computer int hat it has an OS, runs programs, has files. It has no hardware, though.
	You can use it to run a website.

3.	What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	It is relatively inexpensive, so that has given more server access to users that wouldn't be able to have. 
	Performance is a lot better because the resources to run your programs, websites, etc. stay about the same. A physical server might experince issues because the resources to run programs varies.
	Security is better, because your VPS is completely isolated from everything else, but has its own resources and its own OS. It's like a tiny slice of a huge cake. It's still cake because it has all the same ingredients.

4.	Optional bonus question: 
	Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
	It's a safety issue. If a hacker gets access to your root user, they can wreak all the havoc they want in your system.
