<!-- 9.1 Release 1 -->

1.	What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux 
	-	Open source license so anyone can run the program, and redistribute it
	- 	The ability to change the program to suit your purposes
	-	Small is Beautiful and Each Program Does One Thing Well
		These were originally listed as two different philosophies, but I also read a couple of blogs that tied the two together. Small, simple programs doing one job.

2.	In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)?
		It's memory that has been partitioned off just for you. It acts like a computer int hat it has an OS, runs programs, has files. It has no hardware, though.
		You can use it to run a website.

3.	What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
	-	VPS is relatively inexpensive, which has given  server access to users that 		ordinarily wouldn't.
	-	Performance is a lot better because the resources to run yourprograms, websites, 
		etc. stay about the same. A physical server might experince issues because the resources to run programs varies.
	-	Security is better, because your VPS is completely isolated from everything 		else, but has its own resources and its own OS. It's like a tiny slice of a huge 
		cake. It's still cake because it has all the same ingredients.

4.	Optional bonus question: 
	Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
		It's a safety issue. If a hacker gets access to your root user, they can wreak all the havoc they want in your system.
